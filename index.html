        <img src="number1.jpg" alt="Location 1">
        <p>Ok so I remember this really well, We had just left West Quad and we were heading up together to Bursely. I
            gave you my flannel and was like look it would look so good on you. It was a moment I loved and it was
            before we even started dating. It was the first clothing you borrowed from me and I had felt so honored
            heheh. I remember getting butterflies and you looked so cute in that moment I didn't want to leave you. I
            remember you were so happy and I was so happy to see you happy. I love you so much baby.

        <img src="location2.jpg" alt="Location 2">
        <p>AHHHH Thomukun is where we had our first official date! We got so dressed up and you looked so beautiful that
            day oh my god. It didn’t even feel real that I was going on a date with this amazing and beautiful woman. It
            felt so right being there with you. To this day, we still remember how Sidhi said we had such a
            brother-sister dynamic, and how she didn't realize that we were dating when she ran into us on our first
            date. But this was the first date of many and I have and will always enjoy every single one of them.

        <img src="location3.jpg" alt="Location 3">
        <p>I think that this was my favorite date. I felt like we were like actual adults walking together in the
            garden. It was so beautiful and so were you. I felt like we were married and the fact that you were wearing
            a white dress just made you look like my bride. The reason I actually took you to the garden was because you
            had mentioned that when I would propose, you would want it to be in a botanical garden. AHHHH YOU LOOK SO
            CUTE IN THIS.

        <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY LOVE</h1>
        <p>Dear Luna,<br><br>

            Happy birthday, baby! Today is all about celebrating you, and oh, how lucky I am to have you in my life. I
            love you so much, and I want to make sure you know it, today and every day.<br>

            When I first saw you, I didn't know that we would become this close and that you would become my wife. Just
            like the moon, you've been my guiding star in dark times, and you always know how to light up my world. Even
            if you're being a little bitch, but you're my little bitch<br>

            Being with you for the past year and a half has been the best time of my life. Every joke we share, every
            tear we wipe away, every time one of us burps and the other says nice, every quiet moment we spend together, every time we ya knowww... I cherish them all. You
            make ordinary days feel like the most exciting adventure. With you, I feel like I can breathe and let go.<br>

            My love for you is bigger than the biggest ocean, higher than the highest mountain, and goes on for longer
            than the longest road. I love your smile, your laugh, your phat ass, your everything. You're my rock when times get tough,
            my sunshine when clouds are in the sky. You're the first thing I think (and hopefully see) of when I wake up, and the last thing
            I think of before I go to sleep.<br>

            You're more than just my girlfriend, my Luna. You're my best friend, my partner in crime, my biggest
            cheerleader. I wouldn't want to take on the world with anyone else but you.<br>

            So here's to you, to us, and to many more memories together. I can't wait to see what the future holds, but
            I know that as long as I'm with you, it's going to be amazing.<br>

            Happy birthday, my love. You mean the world to me, and I'm so grateful to be part of your life.<br><br>

            Forever yours,<br>
            Your Sol ❤️
        </p>
